@title StreamFactory
@author ApeWorX LTD.
@dev  The StreamFactory is a simple CREATE2 Factory for a given on-chain StreamManager
    ERC5202 blueprint deployment. Any call to `create` will create a new StreamManager
    deployment using the immutable initcode stored at `BLUEPRINT`. Only one deployment
    per account is allowed to be created, using the deployer's address for the CREATE2
    `salt`. Once the deployment is created, it is registered in the `deployments` view
    function for external reference.
